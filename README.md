Straightline Datalabs Vault App

Purpose:
The Straightline Datalabs Vault is a secure, open-source data ingestion and analysis platform designed to help journalists and researchers access, archive, and search large, sensitive public document sets.

Core Features (in development):
	•	Secure file ingestion and OCR processing pipeline.
	•	Local + Cloudflare-secured environment (Hetzner).
	•	Indexed search with text extraction for large PDF and image archives.
	•	Researcher-friendly modular design (Python, Whoosh, Tesseract).

Ethical Framework:
	•	Committed to transparency, human rights, and data ethics.
	•	No collection of private or PII data; all sources are public.
	•	Built for accountability and accessibility — never for surveillance.

Current Status:
Alpha setup phase — environment and backend scaffolding live.
Next phase: automated document fetch + OCR layer integration.
